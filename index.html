        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <p>Hello, I'm Daniel! Thank you for visiting my portfolio page. 
        I'm an aspiring software developer from Warwick, Rhode Island, 
        and I'm currently enrolled in Coding Temple's software engineering bootcamp.
        I have a background in biology, and I graduated from Rhode Island College with a BA 
        in Biology. I went on to graduate studies in molecular biology, where I realized I could
        use some developer skills to sift through data. That's when I decided to try learning
        to code, just the basics, but I started to really enjoy the work so I kept going. I graduated
        from MIT xPro's program in full-stack software development, and that is where I learned
        MongoDB, Express, Node, and React. I am a nature-lover, and I enjoy the beach and anything to
        do with the ocean. I have a wife, and two daughters who keep me busy and smiling. Feel free to reach out,
        at the bottom of this page you can find links to my social media, and a form to submit your e-mail.
        I hope to hear from you!
    </p>

            <br>

                    <ul class="background_list">
                        <li>Early Years</li>
                        <p>I spent most of my childhood on our family boat during the summmers and working on 
                            the boat during the winter. I always loved the local marine life and enjoyed being on the water.
                            This is where I developed a fascination with biology and the tremendous variety of organisms, 
                            especially in the marine environment.
                        </p>
                        <li>Travels</li>
                        <p>My first major experience traveling was when I was 17, I went for my first semester in College
                            at the University of the Virgin Islands where I played basketball and snorkeled between classes.
                            In my 20's I moved to Guadalajara for a year, and about half of that time I was enrolled in a study abroad program.
                            Both experiences have given me new perspectives on life, and a greater appreciation for different cultures.
                        </p>
                        <li>Writing</li>
                        <p>I have always had a love for writing, and I always wanted to write creatively, mostly poetry and fiction, but 
                            I've found the most value came from my personal journals and observations as a scientist. While working 
                            as an intern, I was able to co-author my first scientific publication on Largemouth Bass mortality 
                            and population dynamics which was the result of years of research. I have the ability to serve as a 
                            technical writer, concise and clear, but the creative side of my writing is what I enjoy most.
